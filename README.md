## What it does (scope)

- **Process discovery** on **already filtered** oncology event data  
- **Performance analysis** (e.g., frequencies, durations, throughput, ...)

## Why it exists

Transparent and reproducible analysis of real oncology care pathways helps improve quality and equity of care through data exploration. **onco-miner** focuses on the mining and analysis layer only, so it can plug into different data providers and dashboards without owning data preparation.
